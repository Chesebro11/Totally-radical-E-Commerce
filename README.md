# E-Commerce Backend Application

## About
  
  This application was built for the intention of maintaining a companie's online database focused on selling of products through the internet.
  I was provided a starter file outlining the structure of the application but with missing code.
  My job was to fill out the models for each data point, the associations between these models and fill out all of the necessary routes on the back-end using mysql and sequelize.
  
## Installation

After cloning the files ensure each of the required dependencies have been properly installed, it is essential to make sure the user sets up their own .env file to access the sequelize database and actually start the server.

Before starting the server the user needs to ensure that the database is created by running the command source db/schema.sql; through the SQL Shell in the terminal.
After the database is created and set to being used run the command npm seed to populate the database with initial data.
